The Bavarian universities offer the opportunity to acquire higher education didactic competencies in a systematic and practice-oriented manner, based on international standards. Through the standardized certification, graduates receive formal proof of their higher education didactic competencies, which serves as evidence of their pedagogical-didactic qualifications. The base level requires 60 working units at 45 minutes each, in the five areas of:
A) Teaching / learning concepts ('Lehr-/Lernkonzepte') 
B) Presentation and Communication ('Präsentation und Kommunikation')
C) Examination ('Prüfen')
D) Reflection and evaluation ('Reflexion und Evaluation')
E) Advise and guide ('Beraten und Begleiten')

To me personally, this program was great, since it helped me to become a more effective teacher, communicator and provider of feedback. I took courses on the Basics of higher education didactics, digital feedback, rhetorics, correcting theses, scientific writing and even on producing your own scientific videos.
