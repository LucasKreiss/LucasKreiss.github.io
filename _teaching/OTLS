Already since 2019, I am supporting Dr. Sebastian Sch√ºrmann and Prof. Oliver Friedrich in the course "Optical Technologies in Life Sciences", which is addressed to students of  Life Science Engineering (LSE), Medical Engineering (MT) or Master of Advanced Optical Technologies (MAOT). I started as tutor for the exerise sesssions and gradually took on more responsiblities. Since 2021, I am giving my own lecture units on Light-Tissue interaction, Spectroscopy and data processing within the scope of this lecture.
