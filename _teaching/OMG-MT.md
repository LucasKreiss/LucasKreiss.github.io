You always wanted to learn how to combine optical and mechanical technologies to investigate biomedical samples in terms ofmechanical properties, such as stiffness, elasticity or even active force generation, as well as optical properties, such as scattering, phase contrast or second order polarization susceptibility?
You also wanted to find an opportunity for cool seminar projects, where you can learn the latest tools for scientific writing, citations and understand research papers, that prepare you for your graduation theses? Then look no further, because since 2024, you can take [OMG-MT]([http://www.vorlesungsverzeichnis.uni-erlangen.de/form?__s=2&dsc=anew/amod_view&amod=zentr/zentr/zentr/115183&autoexports=modules_pversion,modules_semfilter&anonymous=1&camefrom=__sat/studie/lifesc&modules_oldsem=2023s&modules_pordnrtitle=626%2355%23H&modules_pversion=626%2355%23H%232019w&ref=tumstud&sem=2023s&tdir=__mod/fau/techfa/lifesc&__e=542](https://www.campo.fau.de/qisserver/pages/startFlow.xhtml?_flowId=detailView-flow&_flowExecutionKey=e5s1)), a course that Dr. Michael Haug and I designed and teach!
