# Latest updates: 


## Januar 2025: 
Back at SPIE Photonics West, back in SF. This time, I followed up on last year's talk and presented the latest updated on the [MICS project](https://lucaskreiss.github.io//MICS/) in my talk 'Classification of inflammatory tissue remodeling in murine colitis using label-free multiphoton microscopy and a 3D convolutional neural network'. Again, I uploaded a short video version of that talk [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQGPr9gr9TY)

## August 2024: 
In late August, UC Davis' brand-new Assistant Professor [Alba Alfonso Garcia](https://bme.ucdavis.edu/people/alba-alfonso-garcia) invited me to give a talk on 'Label-free Multiphoton Imaging for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases' at the Biophotonics Seminar. Thanks for having me, Alba! It was great to discuss and catch up.

The timing was also great, since I took the train from Davis down to SF just a few days later to attend the [GAIN24](https://gain24.converve.io/), which is the annual conference and talent fair of the German Academic International Networkthe German Academic International Network.

## June 2024: 
I had the great opportunity to present our work on Computational Specificity for Label-free Imaging in a selected talk at last week's [Duke AI Day](https://otc.duke.edu/event/duke-ai-day/). It was great to receive such positive feedback and discuss with you all at my Poster afterwards!

## Januar 2024: 
Happy to have presented the first results of the [MICS project](https://lucaskreiss.github.io//MICS/) at this years's SPIE Photonics West 2024. Hopefully it will be the stepping stone towards an application of label-free imaging and deep learning in research on inflammation. A short version of that talk can be viewed [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQGPr9gr9TY)

## October 2023: 
We are happy that our review on digital staining in optical microscopy has been accepted for publication in the journal 'PhotoniX'. It is a great read, if you want to know more about digital staining and how it is used for the state-of-the-art for optical microscopy. It is also the first publication from the MICS project. The link to the full article is [here!](https://doi.org/10.1186/s43074-023-00113-4) 
 
## August 2023: 
The novel Self-Enhancing Multi-Photon Artificial Intelligence (SEMPAI), from Alexander MÃ¼hlberg, a collaborator of this MICS project, has been published in 'Advanced Science'. Check it out [here](https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202206319)!
