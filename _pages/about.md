I am a [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Global Fellow](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/news/marie-sklodowska-curie-actions-award-eu257-million-to-postdoctoral-fellows-in-2022), a [Postdoc at Duke University](https://horstmeyer.pratt.duke.edu/people/lucas-kreiss) and an [Habilitation candidate at Friedrich-Alexander University (FAU) Erlangen in Germany]([https://www.mbt.tf.fau.de/](https://www.mbt.tf.fau.de/person/lucas-kreiss/). 

Before that, I was a Postdoc (2021-2022) and PhD student (2017-2021) at FAU, where my research was supported by the [Erlangen Graduate School of Advanced Optical Technologies](https://www.saot.fau.de/) and the [Collaborative Research Center "Immune-Epithelial Communication in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases" (TRR241)](https://transregio241-en.webspace.rrze.de/).

My research interests are broadly in label-free optical technologies, i.e., methods that are based on the natural interaction between light and biological samples), as well as computational tools and machine learning to extract meaningful information for biomedical applications. I have particular experience with nonlinear multiphoton imaging, Raman spectroscopy, Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS) and Digital Staining. My research is usually very interdisciplinary with applications for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), Muscle tissue or cognitivie neuroscience.

I teach [Optical Technologies in Life Sciences](https://www.campo.fau.de/qisserver/pages/startFlow.xhtml?_flowId=detailView-flow&unitId=87849&periodId=395) and [Bioanalytik](https://www.campo.fau.de/qisserver/pages/startFlow.xhtml?_flowId=detailView-flow&unitId=104747&periodId=387) at FAU in Germany, and act as as Adjunct Instructor in Prof. Horstmeyers course [Machine Learning and Imaging](https://deepimaging.github.io/syllabus/) at Duke.

Prior to Duke, I graduated from FAU in 2014 with a B.Sc. in medical engineering and then in 2016 with a M.Sc. in [Advanced Optical Technologies](https://www.maot.studium.fau.de/), where I was introduced to the world of optics and acted as student representative and as President of the local SPIE student chapter.
