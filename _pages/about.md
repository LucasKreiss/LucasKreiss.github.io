I am a [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Global Fellow](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/news/marie-sklodowska-curie-actions-award-eu257-million-to-postdoctoral-fellows-in-2022), a Postdoc at [Prof. Horstmeyers group at Duke University](https://horstmeyer.pratt.duke.edu/people/lucas-kreiss) and an Habilitation candidate at [Friedrich-Alexander University (FAU) Erlangen in Germany](https://www.tf.fau.eu/). 

My research interests revolve around label-free optical technologies, focusing on the natural interaction between light and biological samples. It is my goal to find the right optical tools for a given biomedical problem. I have hands-on experience in nonlinear multiphoton imaging, Raman spectroscopy, Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) and Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS). I also utilize computational tools and machine learning to extract meaningful information, for instance by using Digital staining. I enjoy interdisciplinary research and applied those technologies to Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), muscle tissues, cognitive neuroscience or cancer research.

Previously, I held positions as a Postdoctoral Researcher (2021-2022) and PhD student at FAU. During this time, I conducted research at [Institute of Medical Biotechnology](https://www.mbt.tf.fau.de/person/lucas-kreiss/) at the Technical Faculity and at the [group for mucosal inflammation and optical imaging](https://www.medizin1.uk-erlangen.de/forschung/arbeitsgruppen/ag-prof-m-waldner/) at the University Hospital Erlangen. My research was supported by the [Erlangen Graduate School of Advanced Optical Technologies](https://www.saot.fau.de/) and the [Collaborative Research Center "Immune-Epithelial Communication in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases" (TRR241)](https://transregio241-en.webspace.rrze.de/).


Currently, I am actively involved in teaching [Optical Technologies in Life Sciences](https://www.campo.fau.de/qisserver/pages/startFlow.xhtml?_flowId=detailView-flow&unitId=87849&periodId=395) and [Bioanalytik](https://www.campo.fau.de/qisserver/pages/startFlow.xhtml?_flowId=detailView-flow&unitId=104747&periodId=387) at FAU in Germany. Additionally, I serve as an Adjunct Instructor in Prof. Horstmeyers course [Machine Learning and Imaging](https://deepimaging.github.io/syllabus/) at Duke University.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I graduated from FAU in 2014 with a B.Sc. in medical engineering, followed by a M.Sc. in [Advanced Optical Technologies](https://www.maot.studium.fau.de/) in 2016. During my studies, I was actively engaged as a student representative and served as President of the local SPIE student chapter, where I gained valuable leadership experience.
