I was invited to present our latest results on massively parallelized diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) at this year's [Neurophotonics conference](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/PC12822.toc#_=_), as sub-conference of SPIE Photonics Europe in the beautiful Strasbourg.
[Here](https://spie.org/photonics-europe/presentation/Towards-Surface-Correction-of-Deep-Tissue-Blood-Flow-Dynamics-with/13007-9#_=_) is a link to this talk.
The conference was co-organized with the SPIE computational optics, where my collegue Amey Chaware showed the latest results on 3D polarimetry with Fourier ptychography from our group.
