It was a great honor to present the recent progress on the Multi-Camera Array Microscope (MCAM) at the [SPIE Optical Metrology Conference](https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/optical-metrology) in Munich.
[Here](https://spie.org/optical-metrology/presentation/High-throughput-imaging-across-multiple-spatial-scales-with-the-multicamera/12622-54) is a link to this invited talk.
Most of that work great work that my collegues Kevin Zhou, Kanghyun Kim, Mark Harfouche, Roarke Horstmeyer and others.
