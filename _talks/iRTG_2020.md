The integrated research training group (iRTG) of the [TRR241](https://www.transregio241.de/) is an interdisciplinary junior researcher group that investigates different aspects of inflammatory bowel diseases. At this year's ["retreat"](https://www.transregio241.de/irtg-studenten-retreat-2020/),
 I presented the latest update from our sub-project on Label-free Multiphoton Imagaging. 
 
 Together with Marilena Letizia, my poster was awarded with the poster award. The event took place virtually due to the Corona pandemic.
