Together with a group of researchers from the Erlangen Graduate School of Advanced Optical Technologies [(SAOT)](https://www.saot.fau.de/about/overview/), I visted the [2017 Sensors Day](https://cdt.sensors.cam.ac.uk/events/past-events-1/sensors-day-2017) in Cambridge. During the [PhD Showcase](https://cdt.sensors.cam.ac.uk/events/past-events-1/sensors-cdt-showcase), we had the oppurunity to present our posters and chat with other researchers.
