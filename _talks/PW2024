I was happy to present the first results of my EU-funded MICS project at the [Photonic Diagnosis, Monitoring, Prevention, and Treatment of Infections and Inflammatory Diseases 2024](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/PC12822.toc#_=_), as sub-conference of SPIE Photonics West in San Francisco.
[Here](https://doi.org/10.1117/12.3001883) is a link to this talk.
We also uploaded a short version of this talk open to everyone on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/vQGPr9gr9TY?si=POveDyxJ-DdczngD).
