The Optics group at the Arctic University of Norway/University of Tromsø (UiT) organized a [Workshop on Live-Cell Microscopy](https://www.3dnanoscopy.com/successful-workshop/). Together with a group of researchers from the Erlangen Graduate School of Advanced Optical Technologies [(SAOT)](https://www.saot.fau.de/2020/02/27/next-generation-live-cell-microscopy-workshop-in-tromso/), I visited this amazing workshop in the beautiful city of Tromsø to present our Multiphoton endomicroscope. 
My poster was awarded with the poster award.
