The TRR241 is a joint research initiative of researchers in Erlangen, Berlin, Kiel and Innsbruck supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG). The TRR241 aims to better understand the molecular and cellular processes that lead to the development of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (Crohnâ€™s disease and ulcerative colitis), chronic relapsing inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. 
At this year's international symposium ["Vision 2030"](https://transregio241-en.webspace.rrze.de/vision-2030-changing-paradigms-in-inflammatory-bowel-diseases-june-10th-11th-2021/), I presented how Label-free Multiphoton Imagaging can support fundamental research for inflammatory bowel diseases.

Together with Ms. Marilena Letizia, my poster was awarded with the poster award. The conference took place virtually due to the Corona pandemic.
