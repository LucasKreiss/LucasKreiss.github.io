At this year's international symposium ["Vision 2030"](https://transregio241-en.webspace.rrze.de/vision-2030-changing-paradigms-in-inflammatory-bowel-diseases-june-10th-11th-2021/), I presented how Label-free Multiphoton Imagaging can support fundamental research for inflammatory bowel diseases. I am grateful that my presentation was awarded with the poster award. 

The symposium was organized by the collaborative research initiative TRR241, supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG), which aims to better understand the molecular and cellular processes that lead to the development of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (Crohnâ€™s disease and ulcerative colitis), chronic relapsing inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.
